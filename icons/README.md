## Creating Icons

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tool. The icons should represent the MailSift AI brand with an email and AI theme.

### Recommended Design
- Simple, clean design that works at small sizes
- Use the brand colors: #667eea (primary blue) and #764ba2 (secondary purple)
- Include an email icon (ðŸ“§) or envelope symbol
- Add AI/robot elements (ðŸ¤–) to represent the AI functionality
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

### Tools for Creating Icons
- **Online**: Canva, Figma, or any online icon generator
- **Desktop**: Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or GIMP
- **Simple**: Use emoji as base and convert to PNG

### File Format
- Save as PNG with transparent background
- Ensure the specified dimensions are exact
- Optimize file size for web use

## Placeholder Icons
Until you create custom icons, you can use simple colored squares or download free email icons from sites like:
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

Remember to ensure you have proper licensing for any icons you use.
