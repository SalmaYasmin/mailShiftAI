MailSift AI (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a browser extension designed to help users prioritize and summarize their emails using AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your data.
1. Information We Collect
MailSift AI processes the following types of information:
Email Content:
The extension reads the content of your emails (subject, snippet, and, if enabled, the full body) from your inbox page to provide prioritization and AI-powered summarization.
Website Content:
The extension reads and processes content from supported email web pages (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail) to function.
We do NOT collect or store:
Your name, address, or other personally identifiable information (unless it appears in the email content being processed).
Your passwords, authentication information, or financial data.
Your browsing history or activity outside supported email pages.
2. How We Use Your Information
On-Device Processing:
Most processing (such as keyword matching and prioritization) happens locally in your browser.
AI Summarization:
If you enable AI summarization, the content of selected emails (subject, snippet, or full body) is sent to the OpenAI API for the sole purpose of generating a summary.
We do not store or share your email content.
No email metadata (such as sender address) is sent unless it is part of the visible content.
3. Data Sharing and Storage
We do NOT sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
We do NOT store your emails on our servers.
Summaries and settings are stored locally in your browser and, if you enable Chrome sync, may be synced across your devices via Chrome’s secure storage.
4. User Consent
You will be asked for consent before enabling AI summarization.
You can opt out of AI features at any time in the extension settings.
5. Third-Party Services
OpenAI:
If you use AI summarization, email content is sent to OpenAI’s API for processing.
